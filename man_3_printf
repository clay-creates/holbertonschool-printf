.SH NAME
_printf \- prints formatted data according to format specifiers.

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
_printf() will return the length of the string it prints, while printing a variety of data types into standard output.

.SS Format of output
Save for the percent sign, the format of the output will be iterated through like any other character string.
As the program finds the percent sign (aka the format specifier flag,) it will replace the flag with the variable passed in, in order corresponding.

.SS Conversion specifiers
These are the various flags that can be used in this function.

.B
.IP "d, i"
Int is converted into a decimal, then they both are printed in character format.
.B
.IP c
The argument is brought in as an corresponding ASCII value, which is then printed in character format.
.B
.IP s
The expected argument is a pointer to a one-dimensional character array (AKA a string)
The string is printed up to the terminating null byte, followed by a new null byte provided by the code.
.B
.IP %
A way of denoting a percent sign within the string

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon success, _printf() will return the string length that it prints, not including the terminating null byte.
Upon encountering an error, a negative value will be returned instead.

.SH EXAMPLES
.B
.IP Simple String followed by a new line
.IP _printf("%s\n", "Hello world!");

.B
.IP An integer in the middle of the string
.IP _printf("there are %d many pieces of candy in the bowl", 38);

.B
.IP An order you may see at Waffle House
